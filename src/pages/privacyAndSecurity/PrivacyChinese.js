          <p>
            <strong>Your use of Cialfo</strong>: We keep track of certain
            information about you when you use our Service. This information
            includes: the features you use; the links you click on; the type,

            operating system, browser type, Internet Protocol (IP) address, URLs
            of referring/exit pages, device identifiers, and crash data. We use

          <p>
            <strong>
              Cookies and similar third-party tracking technologies
            </strong>
            : Cialfo and our third-party partners, such as our advertising and
            analytics partners, use cookies and other similar tracking
            technologies to provide functionality, analyze trends, track users’
            movements around the website, and to recognize you across different
            devices. Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If
            you prefer, you can choose to set your browser to remove cookies and
            to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject
            cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our
            Sites.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Pixel tags</strong>: In addition, we also use ‘pixel tags’,
            also referred to as clear gifs, web beacons, or web bugs. Pixel tags
            are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in
            function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web
            users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer
            hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel
            Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages and determine whether
            those e-mails have been opened, to ensure that we are sending only
            messages that are of interest to our users. We may use this
            information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Other users of Cialfo</strong>: Other users may provide
            information about you when they use our Service. For example, we
            receive your email address from other users when they invite you to
            join Cialfo.

          <p>
            <strong>Integrations and partners of Cialfo</strong>: We may obtain

          <p>
            We ask that you do not send or disclose to us any sensitive personal
            information (e.g., social security numbers, information related to

            background or union membership) on or through our Service or

                “click-through URL” linked to content on the site. We track this
                data to help us measure the effectiveness of our customer
                communications.

                Where we need to collect your personal information by law, or to
                be able to provide the service to you and you do not provide
                that information when requested (or you later ask to delete it),
                we may not be able to provide you with the service and may need
                to close your account. We will tell you what information you
                must provide to receive the service by designating it as
                required in the service or through other appropriate means.
